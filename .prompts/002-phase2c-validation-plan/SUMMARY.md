# Phase 2c Validation Plan Summary

**4-phase plan: fixtures (7 factories) -> unit tests (102 tests) -> integration -> round-trip validation**

## Version
v1

## Key Findings
- Phase 1: 7 fixture factories covering synthetic observations, mock results, and test line data
- Phase 2: ~102 unit tests across quality (38), self-absorption (30), and line selection (34)
- Key architectural decision: Use factory fixtures with parametrization for deterministic tests

## Decisions Needed
None

## Blockers
None

## Next Step
Execute 003-phase2c-validation-implement.md (Phase 1 - fixtures)
