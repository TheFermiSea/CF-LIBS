# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `cflibs/` contains the library source (core physics, atomic data, plasma state, radiation, instrument models, CLI).
- `tests/` holds pytest suites and fixtures.
- `docs/` contains user-facing documentation and API references.
- `examples/` has runnable configs and sample workflows.
- Root scripts like `datagen_v2.py` and `manifold-generator.py` are utilities for database and manifold generation.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pip install -e "[dev]"` installs the project in editable mode with dev tools.
- `pytest tests/ -v` runs the full test suite.
- `pytest tests/test_plasma.py -v` runs a single test file.
- `pytest -m "not requires_db"` skips database-dependent tests.
- `black cflibs/ tests/` formats code.
- `ruff check cflibs/ tests/` runs linting.
- `mypy cflibs/` runs type checks.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow PEP 8 with 100-char line length (Black/Ruff config in `pyproject.toml`).
- Use type hints for public functions and NumPy-style docstrings for public APIs.
- Test files: `test_*.py`; test functions: `test_*`.
- Prefer descriptive, physics-aligned naming (e.g., `saha_equation_ratio`, `compute_spectrum`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: pytest with optional `pytest-cov` and `pytest-benchmark`.
- Coverage target for new code: >80% (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Use markers to scope runs (e.g., `requires_db`, `requires_jax`, `slow`).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages: short imperative summary (<=50 chars) with optional body explaining what/why.
- Recent history favors verbs like "Add" or "Implement".
- PRs should include: clear description, linked issues, tests passing, and docs/examples updated when user-facing.
- Run formatting, linting, and type checks before opening a PR.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Database generation pulls NIST data and can take hours; store generated DB artifacts outside the repo or in ignored paths.
- GPU/JAX extras are optional; choose `jax-cpu`, `jax-metal`, or `jax-cuda` based on the target environment.
